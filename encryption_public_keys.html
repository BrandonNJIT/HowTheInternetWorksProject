<p>We often transfer credit card information, bank account information, passwords, and emails over the internet but how do we keep them safe? This data is kept safe when being transferred over the internet by using Encryption, the scrambling or changing of a message to hide it. And Decryption, the unscrambling of a message to make it readable. The first version of this was Caesar's Cypher, named after Julius Caesar because he used to encrypt his messages by changing each letter to a different letter a certain number of letters away from the original one, and as long as only the sender and receiver knew the number of steps to go no one else could understand the message if they have gotten it. Knowing that number of steps is called the Key, its the secret password to an encrypted message used to unlock the message. Today's methods are 256 encryption keys, which have every letter shift its own amount of times rather than the whole message one set number.</p>
<p>Symmetric encryption: when both the sender and receiver both predetermine the key its called Symmetric encryption. Instead what is used today is an Asymmetric encryption which has each user having a public key to use when interacting with others, and a private key that they keep as their own. The public key is shared with everyone so they can encrypt a message and send it to you, but ONLY the private key can decrypt the message. </p>
