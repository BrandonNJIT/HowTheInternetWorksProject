<h1>The ways of sending and receiving information on the internet</h1>
<p>Electricity - Ethernet cable. Pros: fast, cheap. Cons: signal loss.</p>
<p>Light - Fiber optic cable. Pros: fast no signal loss. Cons: expensive, hard to work with.</p>
<p>Radio - Wireless. Pros: no cable. Con: signal loss, bad distance.</p>

<p>Bits are transferred between devices and use one or more of the three methods above to travel from sender to receiver.</p>
<p>(Bonus note the Tess in this video came to my high school for google jobs and I have talked to her. She is a very nice person.)</p>
