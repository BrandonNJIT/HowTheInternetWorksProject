<h4>IP stands for Internet Protocol. Your IP address is your address of your computer, where other users can send the data to would be your IP address.</h4>
<h4>DNS stands for Domain Name System. And its use is to connect a name like a web address to a websites IP address.</h4>
<p>The internet is really an architecture that has a protocol that if all users agree to it allows everyone to connect to each other. Traditional addresses are 32 bits long, 4 sets of 8 bits. IPV4 is the protocol mainly used, and it serves around 4 billion addresses, which is starting to become not enough for the world. That's why we are starting to move to IPV6 which uses 128 bits per address. Which allows up to 340 undecillion unique addresses. That's enough for every grain of sand on earth to have its own IP address.</p>
