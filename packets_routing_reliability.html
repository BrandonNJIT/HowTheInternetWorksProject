<p>On the internet connections seem like they are direct and that its a personal connection, when in reality you generally are passing information between other routes. It is sent through packets which is basically the whole data broken into pieces and sent around as bits in packets. These packets are passed through routers along their path to reach the final destination.</p>
<p>TCP manages the sending and receiving of all packets, when you get all of the packets TCP checks for any missing packets, if any are missing TCP will request for a resend. These two protocols work with an infinite amount of different users, in fact more devices makes it better and more fault tolerant.</p>
