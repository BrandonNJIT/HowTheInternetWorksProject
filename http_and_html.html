<p>When you browse the web you start with a web browser, the program that you use to use the web, could be firefox, chrome, safari or microsoft edge. Then you start by typing in a URL which stands for Uniform Resource Locator	. Right when you enter the address your computer starts talking to a server which can end up being miles away. The server uses HTTP (Hyper text transfer protocol) to answer back, this acts like the language that computers use to discuss websites. Your computer sends a bunch of Get requests to the server to get the images and pages that it needs. Such as get /login to get to the login page of a site. Sometimes as the user you are sending information to the server, like when you fill out a form or sign up for an account on the page. When you then do that the server sends back your login screen or the next screen to follow up what you just did. It also sends your computer cookies, which is used to have your PC remember those pages or parts of those pages for future. Your computer sends the cookie ID with its request to load the page in future that will allow the server to remember it is you.</p>
