<h3>Viruses</h3>
<p>In computers viruses are an executable program that will affect a computer, depending on the virus type they may even use your computer as a host and send it out to more and more people. How do you get a virus in the first place? A fake install link on a page, your computer's security could have a flaw or backdoor spot and you get attacked via that. </p>
<h3>DDoS</h3>
<p>Hackers will typically give a bunch of computers a virus, and then control those computers to massively overload a server with requests, causing a Distributed Denial of Service attack DDoS. a DoS attack is when it is done with a lower amount of hosts, and a DDoS attack is when a large amount of systems are used to perform the overload.</p>
<h3>Phishing</h3>
<p>Phishing scams are when hackers send emails that look almost identical to a real website requesting information or something that looks legit. In doing this they are hoping that you will respond and go to the link so that you log in, then they will take your information and use it to log into the real website they were imitating and steal your information or money or whatever they can gather from that website.</p>
